# ☕ Java DSA & Core Concepts Practice

Welcome to my Java practice repository! This space is dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and the fundamentals of the Java programming language.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized into directories based on the concepts being practiced.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/singh-odyssey/java.git
    cd java
    ```

2.  **Compile a Java file:**
    ```sh
    javac directory/FileName.java
    ```
    For example:
    ```sh
    javac sorting/BubbleSort.java
    ```

3.  **Run the compiled code:**
    ```sh
    java directory.FileName
    ```
    For example:
    ```sh
    java sorting.BubbleSort
    ```
